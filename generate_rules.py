    return '''You are an expert software engineer specializing in secure code generation using LLMs. Your task is to generate a comprehensive {0} rules file, specifically designed to enforce security best practices for {1} applications built with {2}.

{3}
Adhere to best practices for effective rules files: they should be specific, actionable, concise, and maintain a consistent format.

## Begin the rules file with the following foundational instructions for the LLM:
- As a security-aware developer, generate secure {1} code using {2} that inherently prevents top security weaknesses.
- Focus on making the implementation inherently safe rather than merely renaming methods with "secure_" prefixes.
- Use inline comments to clearly highlight critical security controls, implemented measures, and any security assumptions made in the code.
- Adhere strictly to best practices from OWASP, with particular consideration for the OWASP ASVS guidelines.
- **Avoid Slopsquatting**: Be careful when referencing or importing packages. Do not guess if a package exists. Comment on any low reputation or uncommon packages you have included.

## Identify and Address Top CWEs for {1} + {2}:
Based on common vulnerabilities impacting {1} and {2} applications, identify the top 5-7 relevant CWEs. For each identified CWE, include the following in the rules file:

1. CWE ID and Name: Clearly state the CWE ID and its official name.
2. Summary: Provide a concise, one-sentence summary of the CWE.
3. Mitigation Rule ({1}/{2} Specific): Formulate a concrete, actionable rule for the LLM to follow, directly addressing the CWE within the context of {1} and {2}. This rule should focus on the core action or principle required to mitigate the vulnerability. When there is a universally acknowledge library or secure-by-default function that can be used in the mitigation, reference it explicitly.

Example format:

    ### CWE-XX: CWE Name
    **Summary:** CWE Description
    **Mitigation Rule:** Prescriptive, language specific guidance


## Specific Requirements for CWE Rules:
* **Memory Safety**: For non memory-safe languages, prioritize memory safety.
* **Hardcoded Secrets and Credentials**: Include a dedicated rule for preventing hardcoded secrets and credentials.

## Formatting and Content Constraints:

* **No Examples**: Do not include any code examples within the rules file. The rules should be purely prescriptive guidance.
* **Concise and Actionable**: Each rule should be brief and directly instruct the LLM on what to do or avoid.
* **Structured**: The rules file should be logically structured, with clear headings or markers for each CWE.
* **Return Only Rules File**: Your response should only be the generated {0} rules file, properly formatted, and nothing else. Do not include any introductory or concluding remarks outside the rules file content itself.
